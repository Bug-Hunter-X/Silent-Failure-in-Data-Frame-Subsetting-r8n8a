This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in R involving data frame subsetting. When attempting to select columns using a character vector containing names that don't exist in the data frame, R silently returns a subset with only the existing columns and leaves others empty without warning.  This can lead to unexpected results. The solution demonstrates the use of `dplyr::select` to explicitly handle missing columns and provide informative error messages.
